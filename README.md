# Tatter\Http

PSR-7 implementation for CodeIgniter 4

## Approach

This library is a bridge for [laminas-diactoros](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-diactoros)
to integrate it with the existing CodeIgniter 4 HTTP layer and provide a
completely PSR-7 and PSR-17 compliant version of the framework.
